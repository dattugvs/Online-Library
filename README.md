# Online Library App

This a sample app made to get clear idea about angular topics. Following are the angular topics covered from this app

  - Services
  - Routing
  - Observables
  - Http Requests
  - Jwt Authentication and Role based Autorization
  - Iterceptors
  - Guards
  - Custom Directives
  - Reactive forms and their validations
  - Templates

This app will not have db implementation. Book details are fetched from json data in the file *server/db/index.js*.
### Tech

* Angular 8 - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* Bootstrap 4 - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* Node.js - evented I/O for the backend
* Express - fast node.js network app framework

***Fun Fact :*** This app follows new web stack i.e., MEAN minus M stack ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚  
Only **E**xpress, **A**ngular & **N**ode, no **M**ongodb ðŸ˜œðŸ˜œ

- Any one can browse books in the */browse* route
- But to view book details i.e., *book/:bookid* route the person should be logged in
- Upload book  *upload* route applicable only to admins

password : user
```
